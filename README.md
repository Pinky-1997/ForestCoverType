# ForestCoverType
1. Data Exploration: Explored the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables (wilderness areas and soil types), and scale numerical features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize relationships between variables, check for correlations, and understand feature importance.
4. Feature Engineering: Select relevant features, potentially create new features, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
5. Model Selection: Evaluate various machine learning models suitable for multi-class classification, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Neural Networks.
6. Model Evaluation: Use appropriate metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) to evaluate model performance on a validation set.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters to improve performance.
8. Cross-validation Results: Validate models to ensure robustness.

## Challenges Faced
1. Data Imbalance: Addressed class imbalance in the target variable using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting.
2. Feature Selection: Used feature importance techniques to select the most relevant features.
3. Model Complexity: Managed complexity by tuning hyperparameters and selecting appropriate algorithms for the dataset size and complexity.
