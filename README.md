# ForestCoverType
Data Exploration: Explored the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables (wilderness areas and soil types), and scale numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize relationships between variables, check for correlations, and understand feature importance.
Feature Engineering: Select relevant features, potentially create new features, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
Model Selection: Evaluate various machine learning models suitable for multi-class classification, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Use appropriate metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) to evaluate model performance on a validation set.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model parameters to improve performance.
Cross-validation Results: Validate models to ensure robustness.

## Challenges Faced
Data Imbalance: Address class imbalance in the target variable using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting.
Feature Selection: Use feature importance techniques (like permutation importance or SHAP values) to select the most relevant features.
Model Complexity: Manage complexity by tuning hyperparameters and selecting appropriate algorithms for the dataset size and complexity.
